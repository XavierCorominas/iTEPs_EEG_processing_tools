The present repository contains **example preprocessing TMS-EEG scripts** to recover immediate transcranial evoked potentials (iTEP) from raw EEG recordings.

In the case the TMS pulse artifact wants to be conserved in the dataset, a **simple preprocessing** (e.g., **preprocessing_simple.m**) is necessary and sufficient when TMS-EEG data is not contaminated with large physiological and non-physiological artifacts. "Preprocessing simple.m" employs basic processing features including bandpass filtering. Given that TMS pulse is not removed, the filtering produces ringing signal artifacts.If that represents a serious concern for your analyses and conclusions, a simple processing but employing detrending instead of filtering is recomended (**preprocessing_simple_detrending.m**).


In the case the TMS pulse artifact wants to be removed from the dataset, a **basic preprocessing** (e.g., **preprocessing_basic.m**) is necessary and sufficient when TMS-EEG data is not contaminated with large physiological and non-physiological artifacts, and iTEPS are visible during evoked responses observed online during TMS experiments. A **advanced preprocessing** (e.g., **preprocessing_advanced.m**) is necessary and sufficient when TMS-EEG data is contaminated with large muscular or other types of artifacts overimposing to the iTEPS.
